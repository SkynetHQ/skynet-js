# Changelog (Beta)

_Beta versions are released on the `beta` stream. The latest beta can be installed with `npm install skynet-js@beta`._

For the latest stable changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## [4.0.26-beta]

### Added

- Added SkyDB V2.
  - SkyDB V2 can be accessed with `client.dbV2`, `client.fileV2`, and
    `mySky.dbV2`.
  - SkyDB V2 methods use a revision number cache internally,
    improving performance and correctness.
  - `setJSON` does not make a network request to get the latest revision number,
    so you must always call `getJSON` first.
- Errors caused by network requests to `skyd` are now type
  `ExecuteRequestError`.
  - This error type is fully compatible with `AxiosError`.
  - Errors from failed requests now contain a message with the original message
    from axios as well as the full context from `skyd`.
  - `ExecuteRequestError` also contains `.responseMessage` and
    `.responseStatus`.
  - `ExecuteRequestError` can be used with `instanceof` (unlike AxiosError).
- Parallel uploads for large files have been fixed and re-enabled. This should
  improve performance.

## [4.0.25-beta]

### Added

- Add option for portal API keys and env var for integration tests

## [4.0.24-beta]

### Added

- Added ability to set custom cookie in integration tests with the `SKYNET_JS_INTEGRATION_TEST_CUSTOM_COOKIE` env var.

## [4.0.22-beta]

Revert `4.0.21-beta`.

## [4.0.21-beta]

### Changed

- **[Breaking change]** - SkyDB methods now use a revision number cache
  internally, improving performance and correctness. `setJSON` no longer makes a
  network request to get the latest revision number, so you must always call
  `getJSON` first.
- **[Breaking change]** - Errors from `skyd` requests are now type
  `ExecuteRequestError` as opposed to `AxiosError`. The axios error can be
  retrieved with `.originalError`.
- Error messages from `skyd` requests now contain the full, descriptive error
  response returned from `skyd`.
- Parallel uploads for large files have been fixed and re-enabled. This should
  improve performance.

### Removed

- **[Breaking change]** The `getEntry` `timeout` option has been removed as it no longer has an effect.

### Changed

- **[Breaking change]** `client.db.getJSON` no longer returns `{ data, revision }` but instead `{ data, skylink }`.

- **[Breaking change]** `client.portalUrl` is now an async method instead of a variable.

- Fixed Range Error on unicode data keys.

_This beta version is released on the `beta` stream. It can be installed with `npm install skynet-js@beta`._

### Added

- `getFileContent` and `getFileContentHns` methods have been added for getting the content of a file from a skylink or Handshake domain without downloading the file in-browser.
